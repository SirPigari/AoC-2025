# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) written in [Lucia Programming Language](https://github.com/SirPigari/lucia-rust/) (commit `b750746`).

## Purpose

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 challenges.  
It is intended to showcase problem-solving in the Lucia programming language and serve as a reference for others exploring Lucia.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained in its own directory named `XX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `01`, `02`, ..., `25`).  
Each directory contains:
- `input.txt`: The input data for that day's challenge.
- `solution.lc`: The Lucia code that solves the challenge.
- `walkthrough.md`: A detailed explanation of the solution approach and logic.

## Contribution

Since this is primarily a personal collection of solutions, contributions are not required.  
If you do want to submit improvements or fixes, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Notes

- The solutions are optimized for clarity and learning, not necessarily for performance.
- Some solutions may rely on features specific to Lucia at the referenced commit.
